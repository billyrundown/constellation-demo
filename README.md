# Particle Constellation Demo

An interactive canvas animation featuring dynamic particle physics, constellation-style connections, and mouse interaction. Built to demonstrate AI-assisted development workflows with Claude Code.

## ✨ Features

- **100+ Particles** with realistic physics simulation
- **Dynamic Connections** between nearby particles (constellation effect)
- **Mouse Interaction** - particles are attracted to cursor movement
- **Smooth Animation** using HTML5 Canvas and requestAnimationFrame
- **Responsive Design** - automatically adapts to window size

## 🎯 Purpose
